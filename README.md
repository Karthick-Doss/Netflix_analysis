Enable a single-title view to display detailed information about individual movies or shows.

3.) Tools & Technologies
Excel → Initial data exploration, cleaning, and validation.
MySQL → Data storage, querying, and transformation.
Power BI → Dashboard creation, visualization, and storytelling.

4.) Data Preparation & Cleaning
Imported the Netflix dataset into Excel to check for missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicates.
Cleaned and formatted columns such as Title, Release Year, Duration, Genre, and Country.
Uploaded the cleaned dataset into MySQL for structured querying.
Used SQL queries to:
